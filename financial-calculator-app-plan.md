## Detailed Calculator Specifications

### 1. SIP Calculator

**Input Fields:**
- Monthly SIP Amount (₹500 - ₹1,00,000)
- Investment Duration (1-50 years)
- Expected Annual Return (1-30%)
- Step-up Rate (0-25% annually) - Optional
- Investment Frequency (Monthly/Quarterly/Weekly)

**Output:**
- Future Value of Investment
- Total Investment Amount
- Total Wealth Gain
- Interactive growth chart
- Year-wise breakdown table

**Formula:**
```
FV = P × [((1+r)^n - 1) / r] × (1+r)
Step-up: Adjusted for annual increment percentage
```

**Educational Content:**
"SIP allows disciplined investing by spreading investments over time, reducing market volatility impact through rupee cost averaging. Regular investments can build substantial wealth through compounding. Step-up SIP helps increase investments with rising income, accelerating wealth creation."

### 2. Lumpsum Calculator

**Input Fields:**
- Investment Amount (₹10,000 - ₹10,00,000)
- Investment Duration (1-50 years)
- Expected Annual Return (1-30%)

**Output:**
- Maturity Amount
- Wealth Gain
- Annual growth breakdown
- Comparison with bank FD returns

**Formula:**
```
A = P × (1 + r/100)^n
Where: A = Final Amount, P = Principal, r = Rate, n = Years
```

**Educational Content:**
"Lumpsum investment suits investors with surplus funds available immediately. It benefits from full compounding from day one, potentially generating higher returns than SIP if invested at market lows. However, it carries higher timing risk compared to SIP."

### 3. SIP Target Calculator

**Input Fields:**
- Target Amount (₹1,00,000 - ₹10,00,00,000)
- Time Horizon (1-50 years)
- Expected Annual Return (1-30%)
- Existing Investments (₹0 - ₹1,00,00,000)

**Output:**
- Required Monthly SIP
- Total Investment Needed
- Target Achievement Timeline
- Goal tracking chart

**Formula:**
```
Required SIP = [Target - Future Value of Existing Investments] / 
              [((1+r)^n - 1) / r × (1+r)]
```

**Educational Content:**
"Goal-based investing helps prioritize financial objectives like child's education, home purchase, or retirement. By determining required SIP amounts, you can systematically work towards specific financial goals within defined timeframes."

### 4. SWP Calculator

**Input Fields:**
- Initial Investment (₹5,00,000 - ₹10,00,00,000)
- Monthly Withdrawal (₹10,000 - ₹5,00,000)
- Expected Annual Return (1-15%)
- Expected Inflation Rate (1-10%)

**Output:**
- Portfolio Longevity (years)
- Total Withdrawals
- Remaining Portfolio Value
- Withdrawal sustainability chart

**Formula:**
```
Remaining Balance = Previous Balance × (1 + r/12) - Monthly Withdrawal
Adjusted for inflation impact on withdrawal amount
```

**Educational Content:**
"SWP provides regular income from mutual fund investments, typically used for retirement planning. It offers tax efficiency compared to traditional income sources and flexibility to adjust withdrawal amounts based on needs."

### 5. FIRE Calculator

**Input Fields:**
- Current Age (18-60)
- Annual Income (₹3,00,000 - ₹1,00,00,000)
- Annual Expenses (₹1,50,000 - ₹50,00,000)
- Current Savings (₹0 - ₹5,00,00,000)
- Expected Return (4-15%)
- Withdrawal Rate (3-6%)

**Output:**
- Years to FIRE
- Required FIRE Number
- Savings Rate Percentage
- Monthly Savings Needed
- FIRE timeline visualization

**Formula:**
```
FIRE Number = Annual Expenses / Withdrawal Rate
Years to FIRE = log(FIRE Number / Current Savings) / log(1 + Return Rate)
```

**Educational Content:**
"FIRE movement focuses on achieving financial independence through aggressive saving and investing, enabling early retirement. The 4% withdrawal rule suggests you need 25 times your annual expenses invested to retire safely."

    }
    
    initTabs() {
        document.querySelectorAll('.tab-button').forEach(button => {
            button.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
                this.switchTab(e.target.dataset.tab);
            });
        });
    }
    
    switchTab(tabId) {
        // Hide all calculator panels
        document.querySelectorAll('.calculator-panel').forEach(panel => {
            panel.classList.remove('active');
        });
        
        // Show selected panel
        document.getElementById(`${tabId}-calculator`).classList.add('active');
        this.activeTab = tabId;
    }
}
```

### 2. Input Validation & Formatting
```javascript
class InputValidator {
    static validateAmount(amount, min = 0, max = Infinity) {
        const num = parseFloat(amount);
        return !isNaN(num) && num >= min && num <= max;
    }
    
    static formatCurrency(amount) {
        return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-IN', {
            style: 'currency',
            currency: 'INR',
            minimumFractionDigits: 0,
            maximumFractionDigits: 0
        }).format(amount);
    }
}
```

### 3. Chart Integration
```javascript
class ChartManager {
    static createGrowthChart(labels, data, chartId) {
        const ctx = document.getElementById(chartId).getContext('2d');
        return new Chart(ctx, {
            type: 'line',
            data: {
                labels: labels,
